# MicrowaveClock2000
Desk clock with DHT22 &amp; Azure IoT

## Description
Why not make my life more complicated with this fine project.

I salvaged a 4 digits 7 segments display from an old microwave and decided to use it to make a simple clock but simple shit is not enough so I decided to add a DHT22 temp/hum sensor and push the data to Azure IoT Hub.

I will try to document as much as possible so maybe it will be useful to someone.
